# Deep learning for Mobile::DL4Mobile

This app was implemented using a learned model from TensorFlow. 
The basic implementation uses the educational sample of Professor Kim Sung-hoon, professor of 
"Deep Learning for Everyone(DeepLearningZeroToAll)" (https://hunkim.github.io/ml/) to create a model file, 
and provides a sample using the optimized model. 
Machine learning algorithms that are not part of the lecture are also implemented step-by-step on mobile.

The source implemented with Tensorflow is as follows.

* Linear Regression: https://github.com/nalsil/DeepLearningZeroToAll/blob/master/lab-02-3-linear_regression_tensorflow.org_model.py
* Minimizing Cost Gradient Update: https://github.com/nalsil/DeepLearningZeroToAll/blob/master/lab-03-2-minimizing_cost_gradient_update_model.py
* Multi-Variable Matmul Linear Regression: https://github.com/nalsil/DeepLearningZeroToAll/blob/master/lab-04-2-multi_variable_matmul_linear_regression_model.py
