# Deep Learning for Mobile::DL4Mobile

This app was implemented using a learned model from TensorFlow. 
The basic implementation uses the educational sample of Professor Kim Sung-hoon, professor of 
"Deep Learning for Everyone(DeepLearningZeroToAll)" (https://hunkim.github.io/ml/) to create a model file, 
and provides a sample using the optimized model. 
Machine learning algorithms that are not part of the lecture are also implemented step-by-step on mobile.
